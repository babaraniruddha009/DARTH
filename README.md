You know that the majority of death happened in our country is due to unavailability of blood at required location at the right time. 
So, our project coordinates and sinks data about blood availability in blood banks located at different locations all over the country on a single platform. 
This will provide accurate data about the availability of blood from a nearest possible location. So, we are trying to connect ,Blood Bank and user as well 
as blood donor under hospital authorization on a single platform. The main motive of our project is to provide central repository of information related to 
blood available in blood bank to Government So that whenever major accidents are arises where the blood is needed we are capable to provides blood to victims.
